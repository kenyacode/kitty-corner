kitty-corner
===========
Glenn since I deleted my game yesterday morning, I just HAD!!! to make another one.
So here is the new Repo.  It was good practice for the code and for gitHub.
I know I've been slow in picking this up but I feel like i'm really catching up.

My Procedure:
Since the Starter code was deleted after Meredith uploaded the finished version,
I tried to get a copy of the starter code from other students in class but no one
who was available had it.  So I started with the finished version and deleted all
the html except the scripts and up to  the first container.

I wrote my own containers, my own div's called section and built the app from there.
Then I deleted the css and used some notes I had from the weekend.

The peer review we did at lunch today helped me with trouble shooting, even though my
peer couldn't find the bug.  Allen Mackey found my bug and I finished the app with the
CSS.

I made a new repo on GitHub with the app we made in Stanley's class.  Then I remember what
we talked about on monday morning.  I put the "kitty corner" folder on my local repo in a 
seperate folder outside my Master repo and connected it to the newly made remote 
repo "kitty-corner".  Even typing this read me I can see that I know what is what now,
thanks to Shawn.
